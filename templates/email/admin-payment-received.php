/**
 * The contents of the letter to the administrator on receipt of payment
 *
 * This template can be overridden by copying it to yourtheme/wpstore/email/admin-payment-received.php.
 *
 * HOWEVER, on occasion wpStore will need to update template files and you
 * (the theme developer) will need to copy the new files to your theme to
 * maintain compatibility. We try to do this as little as possible, but it does
 * happen. When this occurs the version of the template file will be bumped and
 * the readme will list any important changes.
 *
 * @author  wpStore
 * @version 2.7.0
